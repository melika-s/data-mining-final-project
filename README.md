# data-mining-final-project

This is the final project of my data mining course. It was supposed to be implemented on the digikala dataset available on kaggle and consists of two parts:
* The decision tree
* sentiment analysis

The second part is not finished and the first part was implemented on a dummy data not the real data.
I wrote the whole code by myself. It was fun!
I recommend you, if you have time and interest, try to implement a whole known and not that difficult algorithm from scratch!
